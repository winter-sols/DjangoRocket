Django Rocket
=============

**A Django SaaS boilerplate**

Django Rocket is an almost-ready-to-launch boilerplate framework powered by `Cookiecutter`_.

.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter

It was initially built to allow me to launch my SaaS projects without having to copy-paste common code, so expect the design decisions and integrations to be targeted for this purpose.

Installation
------------

You don't actually install Django Rocket, you install `cookiecutter`:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install cookiecutter
